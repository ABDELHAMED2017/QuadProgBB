1. There are some tuning options in the code. You should allow them to
be set from outside, just as you can set max_time. Preferably via a
struct.

2. The code displays a lot of stuff, including garbage (missing ; I
guess). There should be a possibility to control verbosity, such as 0
(completely silent), 1 (reasonable display, like the BNB and final info)
and 2 (everything, like now except the garbage)

3. The code should return a numerical status flag (such as 0 means
solution computed, 1 means it was found infeasible, 2 stopped due to
max_time or max_iter )

4. It never hurts to ship binaries.

5. In opt_dnn_compile, I interpreted the comment below as if I should
uncomment those lines. However, what I should do was to edit the c files
and remove the trailing underscores (at least that is what worked for
me)
%% Possible Windows variation
%% In Windows, do not append underscores to blas function names in .c files.
